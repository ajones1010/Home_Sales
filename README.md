2. What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and bathrooms?
3. What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000sqft?
4. What is the average prce of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000?
